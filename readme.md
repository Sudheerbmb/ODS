# Object Detection with SSD MobileNet V3

This project demonstrates object detection using a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V3 model on the COCO dataset. The model detects common objects (e.g., cars, people, dogs) in images. The code uses OpenCV's deep learning module (`cv2.dnn`) to load the model and perform object detection.
